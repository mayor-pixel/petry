# To-Do List App

A simple, interactive To-Do List web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can add tasks, mark them as completed, delete tasks, and filter tasks by status. Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage so they persist on reload.

## Features

- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks
- Filter tasks: All, Active, Completed
- Tasks are saved in localStorage
- Fun animation popup when all tasks are completed

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Type a task in the input box and click **Add** or press **Enter**.
3. Click on a task to mark it as completed.
4. Click the ✖ button to delete a task.
5. Use the filter buttons to view all, active, or completed tasks.
